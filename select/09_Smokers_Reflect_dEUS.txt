The two black spots in your left eye
Are from staring in the sun
They follow everywhere you look
Like a crosshair on a gun
You're lighting one more cigarette
The last one of the pack
Reflecting on your life a bit
Oh you should be doing this
With somebody you love
Scanning purple sunrise
Before you crawl to bed
And hearing Leonard Cohen sigh
Is as deep as it will get
Future is like burning time
The past abiding steam
And the woman that is here tonight
Is a stranger with a dream
Oh you should be doing this
With somebody you love
Oh you're oversimplifying
So often you have pushed away
Until a lonely spring
Comes tell you certain things
There is no use in denying
It's so true what they say
That when the tide is high
You'll jump and frolic and then you'll dive
Until it pulls away
Well everyone's at war it seems
You need a mini truce
And a screw to fix the mantelpiece
Cause it's still hanging loose
The last thought of the morning
As the crimson turns grey
You put yourself on warning like
You're doing every day
Oh you should be doing this
With somebody you love
