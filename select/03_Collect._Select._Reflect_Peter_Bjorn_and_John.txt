Think of me and I will think of you,
Then at least we all can do
What the other wants us to
Be with me and I will be with you,
As to complicate things further
I will always be true

Collect, select, reflect and think
Pick out the things you want and need
They're telling you
You can't always be the center of attention, but you can try,
You can try, you can try, you can try. Try, try, try, try, try

Honesty is easy to act, as a matter of a fact,
It disguises what you lack
Try, try, try, try
